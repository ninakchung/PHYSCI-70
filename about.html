### About Me

Hi! I'm Nina.

<!-- ![image of Nina](./Nina.jpg) -->
<img src='./Nina.jpg' width="300px" position="relate"> 

I'm a senior in Currier House (tree HOUSE) studying Integrative Biology. Most of my time outside of class, I'm at rehearsal or planning events for Currier House as House Committee Co-Chair.
I dance in Expressions and Asian American Dance Troupe, plus I play trumpet for various pit orchestras and ensembles on campus.
I have limited experience engineering and building things from middle and high school. I've also coded (sporadically) for various internships and classes. I nearly majored in engineering for the hands-on and problem solving aspects of it, and I also love the satisfaction of making physical things and seeing how they work. I'm incredibly excited to learn about IoT, electronics, CAD and 3D printing through this class!
