#### Week 2: 2D Design and Cutting

This week, I used Fusion 360 to model shapes that I laser cutted into cardboard!
I sketched shapes in 2D in Fusion, extruded them to 3D, and then converted the projection of that shape into a DXF file which I could then upload into the laser cutter program.
I used standard values of 4.6mm for cardboard thickness, 0.3mm for kerf, and various other lengths of the dimensions of the shapes I made.

Here's my first iteration with the modular design I made (I made it into a shelf/display for all my Currier trinkets):

I also used the laser cutter to try to make a little enclosure/box, seen here:

I actually made a mistake the first iteration of cutting the box because I forgot to account for kerf, so the pieces sticking out (inverse notches) were thinner than I wanted them to be.

I used the laser cutter on the following settings:

max_speed = 30

min_speed = 30

power = 80

And here's a screenshot of my sketch in Fusion 360 of my enclosure walls.
