#### Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication

This week, I made a kinetic sculpture! I learned how to use hand tools, got a bit better at Fusion 360, and learned how to use lots of machines and hand tools in the shop.

The assignment was to make something that included a motor/movement. I was able to use some of the box materials I laser cut last week for the project. It was the same deal as last week for the design: I sketched shapes in 2D in Fusion, extruded them to 3D, and then converted the projection of that shape into a DXF file which I could then upload into the laser cutter program. I used the spur gear plug in on Fusion 360 to make the gear, and I made the whale shark shape freehand using the curve tool. I used standard values of 4.6mm for cardboard thickness, 0.3mm for kerf, and various other lengths of the dimensions of the shapes I made.

I used the laser cutter on the following settings:

max_speed = 20; min_speed = 20; power = 60

<br>

I designed a gear and an oval in Fusion to attach to the 12.8mm diameter dowel, accounting for kerf appropriately.

I then hooked up my motor to the contraption and connected it to the gear that turns the dowel.

When the dowel turns, the stick with the whale shark was supposed to go up and down.



Here are some of the sketches I used for the sculpture that I modeled in Fusion 360.

### Week 10 - Kinetic Sculpture Revisit
<br>
I didn't end up getting my kinetic sculpture working perfectly, so I revisited it using a stepper motor in Week 10. I redesigned it by adding a top to the box that had a hole in the center for the stepper motor to poke out of, and I attached a circular platform to it which turned when the stepper motor did. Here's a video of the whale shark on it (plus the box went through more iterations to fix some imperfect kerf calculations, and now fits together much better than it did in Week 3)

And here's the code that was used for the stepper motor control:
<pre><code class="language-arduino">
int Aplus = 11;
int Aminus = 10;
int Bplus = 9;
int Bminus = 8;

uint16_t step_count = 0;

void setup() {
  pinMode(Aplus, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(Aminus, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(Bplus, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(Bminus, OUTPUT);
}

void pulse_0(){
  digitalWrite(Aplus,1);
  digitalWrite(Bplus,1);
}

void pulse_1(){
  digitalWrite(Aminus,1);
  digitalWrite(Bplus,1);
}

void pulse_2(){
  digitalWrite(Aminus,1);
  digitalWrite(Bminus,1);
}

void pulse_3(){
  digitalWrite(Aplus,1);
  digitalWrite(Bminus,1);
}

void all_off() {
  digitalWrite(Aplus,0);
  digitalWrite(Aminus,0);
  digitalWrite(Bplus,0);
  digitalWrite(Bminus,0);
}

void loop() {

  all_off(); // turn off coils before sending new step.

  step_count++;
  step_count = step_count%4;

  if (step_count == 0) pulse_0();
  if (step_count == 1) pulse_1();
  if (step_count == 2) pulse_2();
  if (step_count == 3) pulse_3();  

  delay(10);  // too short and motor will skip steps

  if (step_count == 3) {
    delay(30); 
  }
 }
</code></pre>

All in all, a successful revision for my whale shark!
