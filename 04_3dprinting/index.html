#### Week 4: 3D Printing

This week I made my very first 3D print! I've only ever handled 3D printed objects, but never printed or designed anything to be printed myself, so this was a very exciting week for me.

<h4>3D Printing a Hook</h4>

I ended up making a small hook to hang up some decorations in my dorm room. Here it is on the printer.

I printed it with supports under the actual hook, so I had to remove those after it printed. Here it is from the side after removing supports.

And here it is in use in my room!

I designed the hook in Fusion by extruding various shapes from sketches, combining them together, and filleting/chamfering a bit. Check it out!

You can download my Fusion file, STL file, and gcode for the hook here.

<h4> Scanning </h4>

Part of the assignment this week was also to scan something. I tried to scan a couple different things using Sense Scan and something else using the Revopoint Pop 2 3D Scanner.

<h5> Rubber Duck</h5>

Here's a pretty bad scan of a rubber duck made with the Sense Scan. I found it was really finicky and hard to use, plus it fused things together wrong, as you can see here in the model it generated. Looks vaguely like a two-headed rubber duck with a lot of added noise, like the platform it was resting on and various other points the scanner mistakenly picked up.

<h5> Statue </h5>

I also tried to scan a small bust of someone's head using a different scanner, and those turned out better. I used a moving turntable and a stationary Revopoint Pop 2 3D Scanner.
On the first attempt, I moved the camera higher to get more of the top of the figure's head. It ended up confusing the scanner a little bit, so I just didn't move the camera the second time and it turned out much clearer.
I didn't take any screenshots on the shared lab computer, but maybe you can download these object files and see the results of these scans for yourself...
