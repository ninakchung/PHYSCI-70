#### Week 1: Final Project Proposal


<h5> Inspiration </h5>

Here is my idea for a final project: a plant waterer!

<h5> Background/Story </h5>

Every winter break, I always have to find a plant sitter, or just leave my plant to dry out for a month when I'm away. But what if I could make something that could periodically water my plants remotely?

<h5> Proposed Solution </h5>

It would have multiple (at least 2, for the 2 plants I currently have in my room) movable spouts connected to a water tank, and you could program each spout to water a particular amount for the plant it leads to. Each spout can be programmed to water on a schedule particular to that plant.

<h5> Research - links, photos, text </h5>

(Links to be added here)

<h5> Weekly Updates </h5>

Week 3 - 9/16/22

I discussed my final project with Ibrahim and he confirmed it was possible - yay! He also gave me some cool ideas for how to design the device and make it more extendable to different circumstances, not just my own.
He suggested:
-considering light in addition to just water as a factor in plant growth (adding a photoresistor).
-making it a smart pot/planter rather than a smart attachment to a pot
-adding a screen or speaker and having the plant display a smiley face and play happy music when it's doing well or display a sad face and play sad music when it's in need of water.
-adding customizability to whether it should remind you to water on a scheule, water automatically, or sense the water level itself and remind you to water when it gets below a certain level.

He also had me consider extending how useful the device could be even after returning from winter break!
