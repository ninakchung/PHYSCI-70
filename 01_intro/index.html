#### Week 1: Introduction

Here is my idea for a final project: a plant waterer!

Every winter break, I always have to find a plant sitter, or just leave my plant to dry out for a month when I'm away. But what if I could make something that could periodically water my plants remotely?

It would have multiple (at least 2, for the 2 plants I currently have in my room) movable spouts connected to a water tank, and you could program each spout to water a particular amount for the plant it leads to. Each spout can be programmed to water on a schedule particular to that plant.
