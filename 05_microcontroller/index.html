#### Week 5: Microcontroller Programming

This week, I used Arduino IDE to make circuits and motors do cool things!

I had already worked with Arduino once before, so this week was a bit of a throwback for me. But still, that was in 2015, so it's good to be back. Back then, I used it to power a Servo which powered a homemade robot.

I was able to do several different things with the microcontroller, including LED flashes, powering and changing directions/speeds of a servo motor and a DC motor, and I even incorporated a potentiometer to do so.

Here, I'll share how I set up my breadboard, microcontroller, and other elements to do LED flashes and to power a Servo motor.


<h5>Blink on a breadboard</h5>

I used the following simple setup with a breadboard to make an LED blink. Here's a schematic and a video of the setup and blinking.

<h5>Blink Code</h5>

Here's the code I used (woohoo, no delays here):
<pre><code class="language-arduino">
const int ledPin =  12;      // the number of the LED pin

// Variables will change:
int ledState = LOW;             // ledState used to set the LED
long previousMillis = 0;        // will store last time LED was updated

// the follow variables is a long because the time, measured in miliseconds,
// will quickly become a bigger number than can be stored in an int.
long interval = 1000;           // interval at which to blink (milliseconds)

void setup() {
  // set the digital pin as output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);      
}

void loop()
{
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();
 
  if(currentMillis - previousMillis > interval) {
    // save the last time you blinked the LED 
    previousMillis = currentMillis;   

    // if the LED is off turn it on and vice-versa:
    if (ledState == LOW)
      ledState = HIGH;
    else
      ledState = LOW;

    // set the LED with the ledState of the variable:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, ledState);
  }
}
</code></pre> 

<br>

Here's another way of coding the same thing, just with a more object-oriented programming lens. By making a class called Flasher and a function called led.update(), I could now add additional LEDs to the circuit without having to copy and paste many lines of code.

<pre><code class="language-arduino">
class Flasher
{
  int ledPin;
  long OnTime;
  long OffTime;

  int ledState;
  unsigned long previousMillis;

  public:
  Flasher(int pin, long on, long off)
  {
    ledPin = pin;
    OnTime = on;
    OffTime = off;

    ledState = LOW;
    previousMillis = 0;
  }

  void update(){
    unsigned long currentMillis = millis();
    if ((ledState == HIGH) && (currentMillis - previousMillis >= OnTime)) {
      ledState = LOW;
      previousMillis = currentMillis;
      digitalWrite(ledPin, ledState);
    }
  }
};

Flasher led1(12, 1000, 1000);

void setup() {
}

void loop() {
  led1.update();
}
  </code></pre> 


<h5>Servo Time! (With L9110 motor driver)</h5>

I also used the microcontroller to power a Servo, using an L9110 motor driver as well. I hooked up the brown ground wire and the red wire on the Servo to the Motor A ports on the motor driver using a screwdriver. Then I connected the grounds between the motor driver and the microcontroller, and I connected the VCC port on the motor driver to the 3.3V on the microcontroller.

<br>

I was able to control the speed of the Servo using the potentiometer as well, using the following code:

<pre><code class="language-arduino">
  #include <Servo.h>
    Servo myservo
    int pos = 0;
    int potpin = 0;
    int val;
    
    
    void setup() {
    myservo.attach(3);
    }
    
    void loop() {
    val = analogRead(potpin);
    val = map(val, 0, 1023, 0, 180);
    myservo.write(val);
    delay(15);
    }
</code></pre>


I did the same thing with a DC motor, hooking it up with pins 3 and 4 on the microcontroller, and I could change its speeds as well as its direction with the following code:

<pre><code class="language-arduino">
  const int A1A = 3;  // define pin 3 for A-1A (PWM Speed)
  const int A1B = 4;  // define pin 4 for A-1B (direction)
  
  void setup() {
    pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT);     // specify these pins as outputs
    pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT);
    analogWrite(A1A, 0);   // start with the motors off 
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
  }
  
  void loop() {
    // start the motor at a low speed
    analogWrite(A1A, 150);
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
    delay(4000);              // allow the motor to run for 4 seconds
  
    // opposite direction at the same speed
    digitalWrite(A1B, HIGH);  // switch direction
    analogWrite(A1A, 255-150); // here the logic for speed is inverted
    delay(4000);              // allow the motor to run for 4 seconds
  
    // speed up the motor
    analogWrite(A1A, 0);
    delay(2000);
  }
</code></pre>

<h5>Takeaways</h5>

All in all, these microcontrollers are pretty powerful little guys (and fun, too). I think I'll definitely be relying on them for my final project somehow (automatic plant waterer).
